# AnimalShelter
A multi-module Maven application that implements an animal shelter.

## The point of project and it's theme
In this app, animal shelters have a great opportunity to keep a record of the pets they care for. The breed, age, color and other characteristics of the animal can also be stored. The system basically distinguishes between 3 types of animals: the rescued, the one awaiting adoption, and the adopted. In addition, some shelters can find out about other shelters if you have a problem and want help or just out of curiosity. It is a system designed for internal use and is therefore not accessible to outsiders.
